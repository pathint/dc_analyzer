## Installation and Running 
  First download the file "DC_Analyzer.rar", and then execute the jar file "DC_Analyzer.jar" by the following command line: 
  
```
java -jar -Xmx1024m DC_Analyzer.jar
```

 The user can either randomly choose desired amino acids one by one, or for other specific requests regarding the type of amino acids, such as to randomize one site with amino acids bearing 
a polar side chain (R, N, D, Q, E, H, K, S, and T), or a hydrophobic one (A, G, H, I, L, M, F, W, Y, and V), the user can directly click a radio button between two solid lines to toggle a group of involved amino acids. The user can then specify the maximal number of degenerate codons for encoding the desired amino acids. After clicking "Proc" button, the exploration of top 5 best schemes for each number of degenerate codons is on the way.
